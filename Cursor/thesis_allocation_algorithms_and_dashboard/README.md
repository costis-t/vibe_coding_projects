# Thesis Topic Allocator Algorithms and Dashboard with Streamlit

## License
GPLv3

## Intro
Optimally assigns each student to exactly one thesis topic while maximizing preference satisfaction and respecting:
* Per-topic capacities
* Per-coach total capacities
* Per-department desired minimums (soft/hard)
* Individual tiers/ranks/bans/overrides
* Forced topic assignments

## Key Features
As Cursor/anthropic haiku wrote:
* ✅ Multiple Algorithms: ILP (optimal), Flow (fast), Hybrid (verified)
* ✅ Forced Assignments: Lock students to specific topics
* ✅ Configuration Management: JSON-based config files
* ✅ Input Validation: Comprehensive checks with clear error messages
* ✅ Structured Logging: Debug-friendly logging with color output
* ✅ Type-Safe: Full type hints for IDE support
* ✅ Modular Architecture: Clean separation of concerns
* ✅ Visualizations: Sankey diagrams for flow analysis
